        "1. Code a subprocedure that simulates the arrival times of customers throughout the day.\n",

        "# **More Possible Senarios to Consider**\n",
        "Here are the 10 extensions with specific details added to guide the scenarios:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Variable Customer Arrival Rates**:\n",
        "   - Assume peak hours are 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM and 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM with a customer arrival rate of 15 customers/hour (Poisson process). Off-peak hours have a rate of 5 customers/hour. Analyze how these fluctuations impact waiting times and required staff levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Customer Groups and Table Sizes**:\n",
        "   - Assume 40% of arrivals are groups of 2, 30% groups of 4, and 30% single customers. Each group requires appropriately sized tables (2-seater, 4-seater). Simulate how accommodating these groups affects wait times and table utilization.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Menu Complexity and Service Time**:\n",
        "   - Introduce two menu types: a \"Basic Menu\" with an average service time of 15 minutes (Exponential, rate = 4) and a \"Gourmet Menu\" with an average service time of 30 minutes (Exponential, rate = 2). Determine how changing 50% of the orders to the Gourmet Menu affects overall service efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Special Events or Promotions**:\n",
        "   - Simulate a Friday night \"Happy Hour\" from 5:00 PM - 7:00 PM with an increased arrival rate of 20 customers/hour. Customers during this period spend an average of 30 dollars per meal instead of 50 dollars. Evaluate its profitability compared to regular evenings.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Customer Patience and Abandonment**:\n",
        "   - Assume customers are willing to wait up to 10 minutes on average (Exponential patience distribution with rate = 0.1). After this, 25% of them leave without being served. Analyze the impact of adding an extra chef to reduce abandonment rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Multi-Level Staff Management**:\n",
        "   - Introduce a model with 2 waitstaff for every chef, where waitstaff handle seating and order-taking, reducing the chef's service time from 15 minutes to 10 minutes on average (Exponential, rate = 6). Analyze how this division of labor impacts profits and downtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Dynamic Pricing**:\n",
        "   - Assume dynamic pricing increases meal costs by 20% during peak hours (lunch and dinner) and reduces them by 10% during off-peak hours. Evaluate its impact on daily revenue and peak-hour customer retention.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Delivery and Takeout Orders**:\n",
        "   - Assume 30% of customers during off-peak hours order takeout, requiring 75% of the service time of dine-in customers (Exponential service rate = 8). Analyze the kitchen workload and the effect on dine-in service times.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Seasonal Variations**:\n",
        "   - Assume summer months (June-August) increase arrival rates to 12 customers/hour on average, while winter months (December-February) reduce them to 8 customers/hour. Evaluate staffing and profitability adjustments required for these changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Health and Safety Constraints**:\n",
        "    - Simulate a social distancing policy limiting occupancy to 3 active dining tables at any time, with one chef per table. Customers have a 20% higher patience threshold (average of 12 minutes). Assess how this restriction affects customer satisfaction and revenue.\n",
